              A functional linear regression model made from scratch using numpy and matplotlib
              which can predict a line of best fit when given a set of data.
              The model works by using gradient descent to minimise the error in
              the predicted dataset. For the next step I am thinking about expanding
              the model so that it can work on data with more independent variables
              and possibly polynomial regression.

              I have been working on making an AI in Processing to play doodle jump.
              This is an ongoing project and is turning out to be very complicated,
              but I am enjoying the challenge and learning new skills and concepts!
              I had to code the game from scratch in the Processing language which
              was the easiest step, and am now working on designing and implementing
              the neural network within the game. I have managed to get to the stage
              where the network is giving inputs to the player, so the next stage is
              teaching the neural network to learn from its failures. The network
              consists of an input layer which takes variables from within the game,
              a hidden layer and an output layer which decides whether the player
              should go left, right, or do nothing.

              I have written a web app which solves polyword puzzles, when the aim is to
              find as many words as possible consisting of 9 given letters, including a
              "key" letter which must be in every word. Feel free to check it out

              I wrote a script which fetches a random fact about a number
              from an API, I wrote it to help learn about APIs. Unfortunately the
              API I used uses http rather than https, so it won't work here...
              I did do it though!

              I am currently following a lecture series on deep learning in
              Python using Theano and Keras, this was the first simple model,
              it optimises a single layer perceptron to estimate the parameters
              of a graph based on a group of noisy points.
