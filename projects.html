              I have written a web app which solves polyword puzzles, when the aim is to
              find as many words as possible consisting of 9 given letters, including a
              "key" letter which must be in every word. Feel free to check it out

              I wrote a script which fetches a random fact about a number
              from an API, I wrote it to help learn about APIs. Unfortunately the
              API I used uses http rather than https, so it won't work here...
              I did do it though!

              I am currently following a lecture series on deep learning in
              Python using Theano and Keras, this was the first simple model,
              it optimises a single layer perceptron to estimate the parameters
              of a graph based on a group of noisy points.
