              Still making progress on the algorithm, I have implemented the goal-seeking behaviour, but am still
              getting the problem of the algorithm iterating twice then converging on a single, not particularly good,
              path. Need to do a bit of a deep dive into what goes on between iterations 2 and 3. But still, progress is
              good, and it is nice to see it starting to come together.

              Making progress on the algorithm, I have updated it to save the path of the mols and begun to
              code the cloning mechanism, where the next generation will learn from the path of the best versions
              from the previous. The lack of visual feedback which was present in the Java version of this project
              is presenting an interesting challenge, as it is difficult to tell how well it is working. I suppose
              that is half the fun though!

              I have recently started to remake my genetic algorithm in Python (again), just to keep my coding
              skills improving, and am trying to do it completely unaided this time. It is going quite well so
              far, I have got the particles moving and am producing values for fitness, so the next step is
              just to put in the actual genetic part, easy... Code is <a href="https://github.com/maxwell64/Python/tree/master/pyalg">here</a>
              and will continue to be updated this time!

              I trained a model to predict whether a protein is a prion (a misfolded protein) using scikitlearn
              in Python. It has a ~98% accuracy level which is pretty good! It bases its predictions on the mass
              and weight of the proteins, taken from a dataset from microsoft. Below is the graph comparing the
              false positive rate and the true positive rate of the model.

              Continuing my foray into data science, I am finding it more engaging every day. Today I
              did an exercise analyising temperature data since the beginning of the industrial revolution,
              to show the effect on the climate. The graph below (apologies for the cut off axis title) shows
              the temperature change over the last ~140 years, with a predicted regression line.
              The line also incorporates indicators of expected fluctuation over time based on the data,
              and shows we are currently far above the predicted point for this time and accelerating.

              scheme, a free bank of resources and exercises from microsoft covering a vast range of topics
              using their resources. Specifically, I have been working through their data science
              learning paths, which are proving very useful and I have learned a lot. They cover every
              aspect starting from using numpy for basic regression predictions up to using a recurrent
              neural network to write a (very illegible) story! I would highly recommend, there are also

              Put the finishing touches on the linear regression model this morning. It is now
              capable of predicting a full line of best fit of a dataset with a non-zero y-intercept!
              Had a few issues with the plotting in matplotlib but it turned out I was unnecessarily
              complicating the issue. Of course this is only the algorithm for one independent
              variable, the x coordinates of the data were just a simple range, but it is
              pretty good if I do say so myself!

              I spent some time about a month ago working on this, it is a genetic algorithm
              which optimises the path of some dots (or "rocks") to a goal. The model can
              incorporate obstacles of varying sizes and is pretty fun to watch! This particular
              model is interesting because in order to get around the second obstacle and reach
              the goal the dots have to travel away from the goal. This means it can take a while
              to optimise...

            <p>
              I thought I would write a post about what I did for my MSc thesis to give some background
              on my chemistry career. My thesis was in the field of organic photovoltaics (solar cells)
              and focused on the development of a novel type of window electrode for use in these devices.
              To explain, an organic photovoltaic device works differently to a commercial silicon cell
              in that the current flows through the device vertically rather than across it. This means
              that it is necessary to incorporate an electrode as the top surface of the cell itself.
              This presents a few challenges, as the electrode must have good electrical properties
              to maximise current flow but must also be transparent to allow optimum light harvesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will not go into the specifics of my electrodes here, but over the course of the year
              I took the electrodes from concept, to development, and finally incorporated them in
              working photovoltaic devices, and showed that the techniques and design I developed
              resulted in an improvement in performance when compared to a reference.

              This morning I had no idea how to make a website. I did not even consider that by 3.37 in the
              afternoon I would be designing my own webpage. Then I found a section on <a href = https://getmimo.com>Mimo</a> (an excellent
              website with courses covering a vast range of programming languages and concepts)
              about making a webpage and having already finished the section I had planned for the
              day thought I would give it a shot.
            </p>
            <p>
              It turns out that designing and coding a webpage is a lot easier than I thought and html is
              actually a very sensible language. It seems like web design will be a very useful skill to
              have. Given a little more training I might even be able to do some work as a web developer!
