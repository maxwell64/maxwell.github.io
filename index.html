            <p>
              I spent some time taeching myself about artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
              part of which was coding this: a genetic algorithm which optimises the path of some 
              dots (or "rocks") to a goal. The model can incorporate obstacles of varying sizes and 
              is pretty fun to watch! The green dot is a clone of the best-performing dot from the 
              previous generation. This particular example is interesting as it require the dots to
              go agains the best-performing dot in order to get around the second obstacle and reach
              the goal. This can take quite a while!

              I thought I would write a post about what I did for my MSc thesis to give some background
              on my chemistry career. My thesis was in the field of organic photovoltaics (solar cells)
              and focused on the development of a novel type of window electrode for use in these devices.
              To explain, an organic photovoltaic device works differently to a commercial silicon cell
              in that the current flows through the device vertically rather than across it. This means
              that it is necessary to incorporate an electrode as the top surface of the cell itself.
              This presents a few challenges, as the electrode must have good electrical properties
              to maximise current flow but must also be transparent to allow optimum light harvesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will not go into the specifics of my electrodes here, but over the course of the year
              I took the electrodes from concept, to development, and finally incorporated them in
              working photovoltaic devices, and showed that the techniques and design I developed
              resulted in an improvement in performance when compared to a reference.

            <p>
              This morning I had no idea how to make a website. I did not even consider that by 3.37 in the
              afternoon I would be designing my own webpage. Then I found a section on <a href = https://getmimo.com>Mimo</a> (an excellent
              website with courses covering a vast range of programming languages and concepts)
              about making a webpage and having already finished the section I had planned for the
              day thought I would give it a shot.
            </p>
            <p>
              It turns out that designing and coding a webpage is a lot easier than I thought and html is
              actually a very sensible language. It seems like web design will be a very useful skill to
              have. Given a little more training I might even be able to do some work as a web developer!
              (fingers firmly crossed)
