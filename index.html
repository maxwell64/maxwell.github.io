              Added a few more improvements to the python expense tracker! I refreshed myself on SQL and it now saves
              expenses to a database using sqlite3, and can load expenses from the database. Relearning SQL was useful
              and the tracker should be a lot simpler to improve now. Next step is adding some graphs!

              Great news! I found the bug in my pyalg code! It turns out I had put a 'while' statement in the parent
              selection function when I should have put an 'if'. The code was just adding the fitness of the same mol
              to the sum until it passed the random value, then picking that mol as every parent! The code now runs a
              lot better!

              Progress with pyalg is still a bit halted by the convergence bug, so I have started a new project to
              distract myself, so I have something else to work on! (I swear I will keep going with pyalg in the
              background) I have started to write a little expenses tracker, working with PySimpleGUI which is new to
              me. Progress is good so far, it is fun to be working with a GUI and it has proved very simple to pick
              up and work with! I am aiming to grow the program into a utility able to track expenses over time and
              provide a graphical output using pyplot. Code is <a href = 'https://github.com/maxwell64/Python/tree/master/expenses_tracker'>here</a>.

              Still making progress on the algorithm, I have implemented the goal-seeking behaviour, but am still
              getting the problem of the algorithm iterating twice then converging on a single, not particularly good,
              path. Need to do a bit of a deep dive into what goes on between iterations 2 and 3. But still, progress is
              good, and it is nice to see it starting to come together.

              code the cloning mechanism, where the next generation will learn from the path of the best versions
              from the previous. The lack of visual feedback which was present in the Java version of this project
              is presenting an interesting challenge, as it is difficult to tell how well it is working. I suppose

              I have recently started to remake my genetic algorithm in Python (again), just to keep my coding

              far, I have got the particles moving and am producing values for fitness, so the next step is
              just to put in the actual genetic part, easy... Code is <a href="https://github.com/maxwell64/Python/tree/master/pyalg">here</a>

              Continuing my foray into data science, I am finding it more engaging every day. Today I
              did an exercise analyising temperature data since the beginning of the industrial revolution,
              to show the effect on the climate. The graph below (apologies for the cut off axis title) shows
              the temperature change over the last ~140 years, with a predicted regression line.
              The line also incorporates indicators of expected fluctuation over time based on the data,
              and shows we are currently far above the predicted point for this time and accelerating.

              Put the finishing touches on the linear regression model this morning. It is now
              capable of predicting a full line of best fit of a dataset with a non-zero y-intercept!
              Had a few issues with the plotting in matplotlib but it turned out I was unnecessarily
              complicating the issue. Of course this is only the algorithm for one independent
              variable, the x coordinates of the data were just a simple range, but it is
              pretty good if I do say so myself!

              I spent some time about a month ago working on this, it is a genetic algorithm
              which optimises the path of some dots (or "rocks") to a goal. The model can
              incorporate obstacles of varying sizes and is pretty fun to watch! This particular
              model is interesting because in order to get around the second obstacle and reach
              the goal the dots have to travel away from the goal. This means it can take a while

            <p>
              I thought I would write a post about what I did for my MSc thesis to give some background
              on my chemistry career. My thesis was in the field of organic photovoltaics (solar cells)
              and focused on the development of a novel type of window electrode for use in these devices.
              To explain, an organic photovoltaic device works differently to a commercial silicon cell
              in that the current flows through the device vertically rather than across it. This means
              that it is necessary to incorporate an electrode as the top surface of the cell itself.
              This presents a few challenges, as the electrode must have good electrical properties
              to maximise current flow but must also be transparent to allow optimum light harvesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will not go into the specifics of my electrodes here, but over the course of the year
              I took the electrodes from concept, to development, and finally incorporated them in
              working photovoltaic devices, and showed that the techniques and design I developed
              resulted in an improvement in performance when compared to a reference.

              This morning I had no idea how to make a website. I did not even consider that by 3.37 in the
              afternoon I would be designing my own webpage. Then I found a section on <a href = https://getmimo.com>Mimo</a> (an excellent
              website with courses covering a vast range of programming languages and concepts)
              about making a webpage and having already finished the section I had planned for the
              day thought I would give it a shot.
            </p>
            <p>
              It turns out that designing and coding a webpage is a lot easier than I thought and html is
              actually a very sensible language. It seems like web design will be a very useful skill to
              have. Given a little more training I might even be able to do some work as a web developer!
